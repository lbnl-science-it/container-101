The main document is container-101.html (or container-101_slides.html if you prefer a version that appears in slide-show format rather than as one long HTML page).

To directly view the HTML, please click [here](https://lbnl-science-it.github.io/container-101/container-101.html).

If you're not familiar with Git or Github you can download the materials as a [zip file](https://github.com/lbnl-science-it/container-101/archive/master.zip)

This material is also available at http://scs.lbl.gov/getting-help

We will have a video recording of the training.
